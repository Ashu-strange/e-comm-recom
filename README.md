# E-Commerce Product Recommendation System
## Overview
The E-Commerce Product Recommendation System enhances the shopping experience by providing tailored product suggestions. This system leverages a phased approach to recommendations, ensuring relevance from the first visit to becoming a repeat customer. The system is designed to improve customer acquisition and retention through personalized engagement.

## Components
The recommendation system is divided into three key components, each tailored to different stages of a customer's journey:

- Part I: Product Popularity-Based Recommendations for New Customers
For new visitors, the system recommends top-selling products to engage them with popular items. This approach helps in capturing the interest of users who are unfamiliar with the site.

- Part II: Model-Based Collaborative Filtering for Returning Customers
Once a customer makes their first purchase, the system shifts to a personalized approach using collaborative filtering. By analyzing the customer's purchase history and ratings from other users, the system suggests products that match their preferences.

- Part III: Recommendations for New Websites Without Initial Ratings
For newly launched e-commerce websites without existing ratings, the system initially relies on product popularity to suggest items. As user interactions and data accumulate, the system will evolve to include collaborative filtering, providing more personalized recommendations.
